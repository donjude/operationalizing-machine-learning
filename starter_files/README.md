# Operationalizing Machine Learning

*TODO:* Write an overview to your project.
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Engineer Nanodegree. It is the second project after the first project [Optimizing a Pipeline in Azure](https://github.com/donjude/nd00333_AZMLND_Optimizing_a_Pipeline_in_Azure-Solution), to build an Azure Auto ML model and productionalize the model.

The main focus of the project is about Productionalizing a Machine Learning Model, so we would not be focusing on optimization or creating a perfect machine learning model, but rather show the processes and the steps in which machine learning models in Azure are productionalized.

This project focuses on two parts using the bankmarketing dataset as described in [Project One](https://github.com/donjude/nd00333_AZMLND_Optimizing_a_Pipeline_in_Azure-Solution)

## Architectural Diagram
*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step. An architectural diagram is an image that helps visualize the flow of operations from start to finish. In this case, it has to be related to the completed project, with its various stages that are critical to the overall flow. For example, one stage for managing models could be "using Automated ML to determine the best model". 

## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screenshots required to demonstrate key steps.
Below are the various descriptions of the Key steps that were followed for the model productionalization.

1. **Authentication:**
Automated ML Experiment
Deploy the best model
Enable logging
Swagger Documentation
Consume model endpoints
Create and publish a pipeline
Documentation

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
