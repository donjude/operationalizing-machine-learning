# Operationalizing Machine Learning

This Project consist of two parts:
1. Shipping and consuming an Automated Machine Learning model in production using Microsoft's Cloud-based machine learning platform **Azure Machine Learning**.
2. Creating a machine learning pipeline

In this project an automated machine learning model is deployed into production using Azure Container Instance(ACI) which deploys the model as an API web service that provides and HTTP endpoint that can be consumed
This Project focuses on shipping Machine Learning models into production as well as automating the machine learning modeling processMicrosoft Cloud-based machine learning platform **Azure Machine Learning**
